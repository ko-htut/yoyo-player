## How is it created ?
  - The data in the source url (m3u8) is regex checked and the child m3u8 files are created and saved according to the respective rules.
  - It starts creating child m3u8 files as soon as the video starts playing
  - Each time a video is completed or the main url changes, child m3u8 files are checked and deleted.

## The child m3u8 files are created as follows:
 - If viedo quality 
   yoyo[vido-quality].m3u8

 - If video quality & audio quality
   yoyo[video-quality][audio-quality].m3u8

## Support M3U8 
 - #EXT-X-MEDIA
 - #EXT-X-STREAM-INF(not for ios)
